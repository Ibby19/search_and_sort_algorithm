    "- Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item it is sorted by definition. If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is quick sort\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quick sort has the same advantages as the merge sort but doesn't use additional storage. Quick sort first selects a value which is called the pivot value. The role of the pivot value is to assist with splitting the list. The split point is the actual position where the pivot values belongs in the final sorted list. The split point is used to divide the list for subsequent calls to the quick sort."
